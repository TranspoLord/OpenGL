# OpenGL
How do I approach designing software?
My approach for this is usually the same for most of my projects. I look at what is needed and what needs to be done. I make a checklist, or a backlog, of items that need
to be done and do them in order. I add, remove, or change any items as needed and keep at it until the software is complete. Aside from that, I do look at the resources needed
for the project as well, making sure to stay in line of the requirements for the software. 

How do I approach developing programs?
My approach is usually the same for all my projects. I start off with a draft of what I need and refine the code from there. Sometimes, I may even just build the program
code block by code block. This is what I did for my OpenGL projects as usually, each assignment was able to be built off from the previous one. Anytime I added new code, I 
made sure I knew what code was being added, this is because OpenGL is touchy and may not like the extra statement you added for something. Keeping the new code seperated 
allows me to quickly remove or edit code that's causing issues. 

How can computer science help me reach my goals?
OpenGL and computer graphics & visualizations help me with my future educational and professional pathway by giving me practice in dealing with different API's, functions,
and researching code. Personally, I don't think OpenGL will be that much of use for future me as I'd prefer to use Unity, but it gives me the knowledge of what
goes on in the backend of rendering programs. Unity actually uses an OpenGL API to render most of their scenes.
